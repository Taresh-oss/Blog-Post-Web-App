# Blog-Post-Web-App

### IDEA
The main idea behind this project is that a user has the option to add his blog post online. User will have the option of adding his name or keeping it as anonymous. Apart from that
the blog post will have details like _title_ of the post, _Author_,  _Content_ and  _Date posted_ on (which is auto-generated). User will be able to add a new post to already existing posts,
edit the post, and delete the post.

So, this application has all the CRUD operations required in a web application.
